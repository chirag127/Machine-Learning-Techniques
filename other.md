##### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous value (e.g. price of a stock) based on the input data. Here are some notes on Linear Regression with reference to Machine Learning Techniques:

Definition: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous value (e.g. price of a stock) based on the input data. It is a linear model that uses a linear combination of the input variables to predict the output.

Training and Testing: Linear regression is typically trained using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values. The model is then evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Applications: Linear regression is widely used in a variety of applications, including stock price prediction, demand forecasting, and credit scoring.

Limitations: Linear regression can be limited by the quality and representativeness of the training data, and may not be able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

##### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a categorical label (e.g. spam or not spam) based on the input data. Here are some notes on Logistic Regression with reference to Machine Learning Techniques:

Definition: Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a categorical label (e.g. spam or not spam) based on the input data. It is a linear model that uses a logistic function to map the input data to a probability.

Training and Testing: Logistic regression is typically trained using the maximum likelihood method, which maximizes the probability of the training data given the model parameters. The model is then evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Applications: Logistic regression is widely used in a variety of applications, including sentiment analysis, credit scoring, and fraud detection.

Limitations: Logistic regression can be limited by the quality and representativeness of the training data, and may not be able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

##### Decision Trees

Decision Trees is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a categorical label (e.g. spam or not spam) based on the input data. Here are some notes on Decision Trees with reference to Machine Learning Techniques:

Definition: Decision trees are a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict a categorical label (e.g. spam or not spam
